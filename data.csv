0,"Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the ""greenhouse effect""1 — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.
Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping",climate change
1,"Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as ""forcing"" climate change",climate change
2,"Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as ""feedbacks.""
Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment",climate change
3,"Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.
Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.
Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities",climate change
4,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.
According to the IPCC, the extent of climate change effects on individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change.
The IPCC predicts that increases in global mean temperature of less than 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 3 degrees Celsius) above 1990 levels will produce beneficial impacts in some regions and harmful ones in others",climate change
5,"Net annual costs will increase over time as global temperatures increase.
""Taken as a whole,"" the IPCC states, ""the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time.
Scientists have studied past climate changes to understand the factors that can cause the planet to warm or cool",climate change
6,"The big ones are changes in solar energy, ocean circulation, volcanic activity and the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere",climate change
7,"And they have each played a role at times.
For example, 300 years ago, a combination of reduced solar output and increased volcanic activity cooled parts of the planet enough that Londoners regularly ice skated on the Thames",climate change
8,"About 12,000 years ago, major changes in Atlantic circulation plunged the Northern Hemisphere into a frigid state",climate change
9,"And 56 million years ago, a giant burst of greenhouse gases, from volcanic activity or vast deposits of methane (or both), abruptly warmed the planet by at least 9 degrees Fahrenheit, scrambling the climate, choking the oceans and triggering mass extinctions.
Here’s how it works: the planet’s temperature is basically a function of the energy the Earth absorbs from the sun (which heats it up) and the energy Earth emits to space as infrared radiation (which cools it down)",climate change
10,"Because of their molecular structure, greenhouse gases temporarily absorb some of that outgoing infrared radiation and then re-emit it in all directions, sending some of that energy back toward the surface and heating the planet",climate change
11,"Scientists have understood this process since the 1850s.
Today, however, we are the ones causing CO2 levels to increase at an unprecedented pace by taking ancient carbon from geologic deposits of fossil fuels and putting it into the atmosphere when we burn them",climate change
12,"Since 1750, carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by almost 50 percent",climate change
13,"Methane and nitrous oxide, other important anthropogenic greenhouse gases that are released mainly by agricultural activities, have also spiked over the last 250 years.
We know based on the physics described above that this should cause the climate to warm",climate change
14,We also see certain telltale “fingerprints” of greenhouse warming,climate change
15,"For example, nights are warming even faster than days because greenhouse gases don’t go away when the sun sets",climate change
16,"And upper layers of the atmosphere have actually cooled, because more energy is being trapped by greenhouse gases in the lower atmosphere.
A common source of confusion when it comes to climate change is the difference between weather and climate",climate change
17,"Weather is the constantly changing set of meteorological conditions that we experience when we step outside, whereas climate is the long-term average of those conditions, usually calculated over a 30-year period",climate change
18,"Or, as some say: Weather is your mood and climate is your personality.
So while 2 degrees Fahrenheit doesn’t represent a big change in the weather, it’s a huge change in climate",climate change
19,"As we’ve already seen, it’s enough to melt ice and raise sea levels, to shift rainfall patterns around the world and to reorganize ecosystems, sending animals scurrying toward cooler habitats and killing trees by the millions.
It’s also important to remember that two degrees represents the global average, and many parts of the world have already warmed by more than that",climate change
20,"For example, land areas have warmed about twice as much as the sea surface",climate change
21,And the Arctic has warmed by about 5 degrees,climate change
22,"That’s because the loss of snow and ice at high latitudes allows the ground to absorb more energy, causing additional heating on top of greenhouse warming.
Relatively small long-term changes in climate averages also shift extremes in significant ways",climate change
23,"For instance, heat waves have always happened, but they have shattered records in recent years",climate change
24,"In June of 2020, a town in Siberia registered temperatures of 100 degrees",climate change

29,And the impacts of rising temperatures aren’t waiting for some far-flung future–the effects of global warming are appearing right now,climate change
30,"The heat is melting glaciers and sea ice, shifting precipitation patterns, and setting animals on the move.
Many people think of global warming and climate change as synonyms, but scientists prefer to use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems",climate change
31,"Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts",climate change
32,"All of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
Earth's atmosphere contains various gases that act as a blanket to trap heat from the sun and prevent it from escaping back into space",climate change
33,"This process is known as the greenhouse effect, and the gases are referred to as greenhouse gases",climate change
34,"The main greenhouse gases that occur in nature are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide",climate change
35,"Without the greenhouse effect, the planet would be too cold to support life",climate change
36,"Over time, the amount of greenhouse gases trapped in Earth's atmosphere has increased significantly, causing worldwide temperatures to rise.
Natural processes on Earth constantly create and destroy greenhouse gases",climate change
37,"The decay of plant and animal matter, for example, produces carbon dioxide, which plants then absorb during photosynthesis",climate change
38,This natural cycle keeps the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere fairly stable,climate change
39,"Shifts in the planet's crust and changes in ocean patterns impact weather, as do fluctuations in the sun's output of radiation",climate change
40,Volcanic activity also affects the climate because eruptions discharge greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere,climate change
41,Climate change scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other federal and international agencies recognize that these natural factors continue to play a role in climate change but contend that the impact of these factors alone does not explain the substantial rise in Earth's temperature,climate change
42,"Natural causes of climate change are referred to as naturogenic, while human-made causes of climate change are referred to as anthropogenic.
Earth's vegetation releases and absorbs more than two hundred billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually",climate change
43,"Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, add an extra seven billion metric tons per year",climate change
44,"Over time, these additions have had a dramatic effect on the atmosphere",climate change
45,"In the past 150 years, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by more than 30 percent",climate change
46,"Deforestation has also played a role in this increase by eliminating forests that would otherwise absorb tons of carbon dioxide.
Increased levels of other greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide and methane have also resulted from human activities",climate change
47,"Several agricultural and industrial activities, such as the use of certain fertilizers in agriculture, produce nitrous oxide",climate change
48,"Methane emissions come from the production of fossil fuels, from landfills, and from livestock",climate change
49,"These gases may cause even more harm than carbon dioxide, even though less of them exist, because they have a much greater effect per pound on Earth's temperature",climate change
50,"Methane, for example, is a greenhouse gas that is twenty-one times as potent as carbon dioxide",climate change
51,"Beginning in October 2015, a methane gas leak from a California storage facility vented about five billion cubic feet of gas into the atmosphere",climate change

Humans have created and released greenhouse gases that do not occur in nature",climate change
54,"These include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)",climate change
55,"These gases, released during such industrial processes as aluminum production and electrical transmission, have thousands of times greater effect on the planet's temperature than carbon dioxide.
Climate science measures changes that occur to a large geographical area over a long period of time, making it difficult to provide definitive answers to climate change questions",climate change
56,"However, multiple studies have been conducted since the 1990s to determine how the scientific community collectively views anthropogenic climate change",climate change
57,"These studies included surveys as well as analyses of peer-reviewed articles and have concluded that at least 97 percent of actively publishing climate scientists around the world agree that human activities have contributed to rising global temperatures.
Though surveys indicate that many Americans remain skeptical toward arguments and evidence put forth by climate scientists, reports suggest that belief in global warming has grown steadily in the twenty-first century",climate change
58,"According to annual polls conducted by Gallup, the public's belief that global warming is caused by human activity, that climate change has begun to take effect, and that global warming will soon pose a serious threat has increased since 2001",climate change
59,Researchers have observed a strong correlation between people's political affiliations and their levels of concern regarding global warming and acceptance of climate science,climate change
60,"A total of 64 percent of all Americans polled reported a belief that human activity contributes to global warming in 2018, which included 89 percent of Democrats, 62 percent of independents, and 35 percent of Republicans",climate change
61,"Similarly, 91 percent of Democrats responded that they worried significantly about global warming, compared to 62 percent of independents and 33 percent of Republicans",climate change
62,Democrats also reported much higher confidence (86 percent) that scientists have reached a consensus that global warming is real than Republicans (42 percent),climate change
63,"Gallup's polling further indicates that people age 55 and older are more likely than younger respondents to believe that the media exaggerates the threat of climate change.
Skeptics of global warming and climate change have noted that Earth has experienced cyclical changes to its climate patterns for millennia and that recent climatic shifts are not as severe as indicated or necessarily a consequence of human activity alone",climate change
64,Climate scientists contend that such skepticism may stem from an unwillingness to face the scope of the threat posed to the planet by human activity,climate change
65,"Additionally, conservative donors, including several foundations established by wealthy families, have contributed large amounts of money to organizations that promote climate change denial",climate change
66,"Foundations linked to the prominent Koch family, for example, donated over $100 million to such organizations between 1997 and 2015, as reported by the environmental organization Greenpeace.
Even if all members of society agreed that global temperatures are rising and humans are the cause, the challenges created by climate change lack an obvious solution",climate change
67,No climate model formulated by scientists to chart climate patterns has had 100 percent accuracy in predicting changes,climate change
68,"However, scientists continue to refine their methods to produce more reliable data",climate change
69,Most climate models failed to predict a slowdown in rising temperatures at the beginning of the twenty-first century,climate change
70,Some predictions have also underestimated threats,climate change
71,"In its initial assessment of rising sea levels in 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) originally anticipated a sea level rise of 1.9 millimeters per year from that year onward",climate change
72,"However, studies by NASA have revealed that sea levels have in fact risen at a rate of 3.2 millimeters per year",climate change
73,The science of climate change is so complex that some actions that seem helpful may cause damage in the long term,climate change
74,"Some of the most potent greenhouse gases, HFCs and PFCs, are commonly used as replacements for other chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were phased out between 1989 and 1996 because they damaged the ozone layer",climate change
75,"Consequently, the same process that solved one environmental problem—ozone damage—contributed to another.
The consequences of global warming remain an issue of great debate and uncertainty, and some researchers predict dramatic and serious problems for future generations",climate change

82,"In 2018 California has further endured massive wildfires that have led to the displacement of thousands of residents, widespread destruction of property, and the deaths of at least eight people",climate change
83,"Scientists have attributed the fires, which included the largest wildfire in California history to date, to the presence of extremely dry vegetation, brought on by rising temperatures, that created conditions that allowed the fires to spread rapidly and burn intensely",climate change
84,"California governor Jerry Brown lamented that such fires have become increasingly common in the southwestern United States and warned that fires would likely become more intense as climate change continues.
Many coastal areas around the world could also face severe flooding due to rising sea levels",climate change
85,Low-lying islands in the Pacific Ocean would eventually become uninhabitable,climate change
86,"Within the past century, sea level has risen by four to eight inches worldwide",climate change
