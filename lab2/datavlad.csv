In computer vision and perceptual psychology, image perception is often analyzed in terms of visual cues",Neural network artworks
2,"
In other words, modern neural models lend themselves to creating interesting imagery, because they were designed modern real images, and so modifying them creates realistic but unreal images",Neural network artworks

Given a large collection of images of a specific class (such as faces or landscapes), a GAN is trained to produce new images that look like they also came from that class",Neural network artworks
5,"
However, GANs operate in terms of image cues that are difficult to explain; they are not just manipulating simple properties like color and texture",Neural network artworks

We now apply the theory to image stylization algorithms",Neural network artworks
13,"
These algorithms take a natural image as input and output a stylized version, such as a painting",Neural network artworks

The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images",Neural network artworks
35,"
The class of Deep Neural Networks that are most powerful in image processing tasks are called Convolutional Neural Networks",Neural network artworks
36,"
Each layer of units can be understood as a collection of image filters, each of which extracts a certain feature from the input image",Neural network artworks
37,"
When Convolutional Neural Networks are trained on object recognition, they develop a representation of the image that makes object information increasingly explicit along the processing hierarchy",Neural network artworks
38,"
We can directly visualise the information each layer contains about the input image by reconstructing the image only from the feature maps in that layer (Fig 1, content reconstructions, see Methods for details on how to reconstruct the image)",Neural network artworks
39,"
To obtain a representation of the style of an input image, we use a feature space originally designed to capture texture information",Neural network artworks
40,"
While the number of different filters increases along the processing hierarchy, the size of the filtered images is reduced by some downsampling mechanism (e",Neural network artworks
41,g,Neural network artworks
42, max-pooling) leading to a decrease in the total number of units per layer of the network,Neural network artworks
43,"
A given input image is represented as a set of filtered images at each processing stage in the CNN",Neural network artworks
44,"
On top of the original CNN representations we built a new feature space that captures the style of an input image",Neural network artworks
45,"
Moreover, the size and complexity of local image structures from the input image increases along the hierarchy, a result that can be explained by the increasing receptive field sizes and feature complexity",Neural network artworks
46,"

47,"
When matching the style representations up to higher layers in the network, local images structures are matched on an increasingly large scale, leading to a smoother and more continuous visual experience",Neural network artworks
48,"
Thus, the visually most appealing images are usually created by matching the style representation up to the highest layers in the network",Neural network artworks
49,"
When synthesising an image that combines the content of one image with the style of another, there usually does not exist an image that perfectly matches both constraints at the same time",Neural network artworks
50,"
A strong emphasis on style will result in images that match the appearance of the artwork, effectively giving a texturised version of it, but hardly show any of the photograph’s content",Neural network artworks
51,"
Here we present an artificial neural system that achieves a separation of image content from style, thus allowing to recast the content of one image in the style of any other image",Neural network artworks
52,"
In particular, we derive the neural representations for the content and style of an image from the feature responses of highperforming Deep Neural Networks trained on object recognition",Neural network artworks
53,"
Conceptually most closely related are methods using texture transfer to achieve artistic style transfer",Neural network artworks
54,"
In contrast, by using Deep Neural Networks trained on object recognition, we carry out manipulations in feature spaces that explicitly represent the high level content of an image",Neural network artworks
55,"

We conjecture that a transformation into a stationary feature space such as our style representation might achieve even better performance in style classification",Neural network artworks
57,"
All in all it is truly fascinating that a neural system, which is trained to perform one of the core computational tasks of biological vision, automatically learns image representations that allow the separation of image content from style",Neural network artworks
58,"
Thus, our ability to abstract content from style and therefore our ability to create and enjoy art might be primarily a preeminent signature of the powerful inference capabilities of our visual system",Neural network artworks
59,"
In texture transfer the goal is to synthesise a texture from a source image while constraining the texture synthesis in order to preserve the semantic content of a target image",Neural network artworks
60,"
Most previous texture transfer algorithms rely on these nonparametric methods for texture synthesis while using different ways to preserve the structure of the target image",Neural network artworks
61,"
Although these algorithms achieve remarkable results, they all suffer from the same fundamental limitation: they use only low-level image features of the target image to inform the texture transfer",Neural network artworks
62,"
Here we demonstrate how to use feature representations from high-performing Convolutional Neural Networks to transfer image style between arbitrary images",Neural network artworks
63,"
While this is less of an issue in the artistic style transfer, the problem becomes more apparent when both, content and style images, are photographs and the photorealism of the synthesised image is affected",Neural network artworks

Transfer learning allows the adaptation or reuse of a network model that has been trained for a specific task using a very large dataset to perform a new, related task for which only a small dataset is available",Neural network artworks
71,"
One of the possible reasons is that standard CNN architectures, used in most studies, require a fixed input image size that is in most cases, significantly smaller than the high-resolution art images offered by fine art datasets",Neural network artworks
72,"
To address this problem, a sub-region approach was introduced in which the original image is divided into smaller regions (or image patches), where the size of each patch matches the standard image input size required by the CNN model",Neural network artworks
73,"
First, the proposed approach divides the input image into patches and applies a deep neural network to train and classify each patch",Neural network artworks
